# gallistaca is a vertical scrolling space game

Your ship is aligned in the centre of the screen

The walls are moving downwards

The walls have evolved. THEY HAVE A PLAN!!

You must survive

===

The map is defined by our cutting edge map designers in a text file.
They are defining the walls with the letter X.
The map must have trail newline character (i.e. an empty line as the last line)

The ship is initially placed at bottom, in the centre.
